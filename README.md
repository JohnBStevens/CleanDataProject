##Purpose
This script downloads, cleans and reshapes data collected during a test of accelterometer readings of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone by different users. The Readme.txt file contained in the downloaded zip file contains complete information. The script and associated files fulfill the requirements of the Getting & Cleaning Data course offered on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University.

##Files
* Readme.md: this file
* run_analysis.R: an R script performing all of the data retrieval and shaping.
* CodeBook.md: a file containing descriptors of all variables and the script process
* meansbyDCast.csv: output generated by the script

##How to Run
1. Place the run_analysis.R file in a working directory
2. Set the R environment working directory to the working directory
3. Type source("../run_analysis.R") <enter> to run the code
4. The output data file (meansbyDCast.csv) will be placed in the original working directory
